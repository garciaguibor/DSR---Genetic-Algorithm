# DSR---Genetic-Algorithm

Electrical Power System. Algorithm in C Programming Language for Power Flow Optimization. Distribution System Reconfiguration. Meta-heuristics: PRIM, Genetic and Multistart Algorithm.

To run the algorithm, download all files from the test systems. The code and files containing the data must be in the same folder. The files with the results will all be generated and saved in .txt in this same folder.

Test system with 14, 33, 84, 136 and 415 bars. It is recommended to use Code Block 20.03 or higher.
