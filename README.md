# DSR---Genetic-Algorithm

Electrical Power System. An algorithm in the C programming language was developed in order to find good solutions to the DSR problem. Meta-heuristics: PRIM, Multistart and Genetic Algorithm.

To run the algorithm, download all files from the test systems. The code and files containing the data must be in the same folder. The files with the results will all be generated and saved in .txt in this same folder.

Test system with 14, 33, 84, 136 and 415 bars. It is recommended to use Code Block 20.03 or higher, or other compatible programming environment. 

When executing the algorithm, it is recommended to save relevant results, or remove them to another folder, as with each execution the generated files containing the results are overwritten by the files from the last execution.

The flowchart of the algorithm developed is illustrated Figure
